                <h2 class="welcometotexas">Welcome to Texas</h2>
                <p class="intro-text">Texas, the second-largest state in the United States by both land area and
                    population,
                    is known for its
                    rich history, diverse landscapes, and vibrant economy. As a state that embodies both modern
                    innovation
                    and traditional values, Texas offers a unique blend of cultural heritage and progressive
                    development.
                </p>

                <p class="intro-text">From the deserts of West Texas to the forests of East Texas and Gulf Coast
                    beaches,
                    our state offers a
                    variety of landscapes and outdoor adventures. Texas’ rich history, including the iconic Battle of
                    the
                    Alamo, is celebrated in historic sites, museums, and festivals.</p>

                <p class="intro-text">Texas, the second-largest state in the United States by both land area and
                    population,
                    is known for its
                    rich history, diverse landscapes, and vibrant economy. As a state that embodies both modern
                    innovation
                    and traditional values, Texas offers a unique blend of cultural heritage and progressive
                    development.
                    The state's economy is bolstered by key industries like energy, technology, healthcare, and
                    agriculture,
                    making Texas one of the nation's leading economic powerhouses.</p>

                <p class="intro-text">Texas is also home to a dynamic cultural scene, with influences from Native
                    American,
                    Spanish, Mexican, European, and African traditions that are woven into the state’s music, art, food,
                    and
                    festivals. Known for its renowned Tex-Mex cuisine and BBQ, Texas also hosts major cultural events
                    like
                    Austin's South by Southwest (SXSW) festival, the Houston Rodeo, and the State Fair of Texas in
                    Dallas.
                </p>

                <p class="intro-text">Texas has a median household income of $72,768, slightly below the U.S. average of
                    $74,580. Compared to states like California ($91,905) and New York ($75,157), Texas falls behind but
                    exceeds Florida's $61,777. Within Texas, Austin leads with $78,000, surpassing the state average,
                    while Dallas ($65,000), Houston ($52,000), and San Antonio ($53,000) lag behind. This highlights the
                    income disparity across regions, both within the state and nationally.</p>
